# Project presentation

I took over a part of the work of Linda Mecherout (https://github.com/lindamecherout/BeeDeckBot-Deeplabcut). The goal of this project is to study the flight of bees using a markerless 3D pose estimation tracking software named DeepLabCut. Especially my goal was to calculate the 3D position error of the tracking done by the software.
